Contributions to pgmpl are welcome! 

Please use the following guidelines when preparing changes:

* Changes should be submitted by github pull request against the "dev" branch. 

* Pull requests should include only a focused and related set of changes. 
  Mixed features and unrelated changes may be rejected.

* For major changes, it is recommended to discuss your plans in a github issue 
  before putting in too much effort.

* Docstrings in functions and classes are required. Use comments as needed. 

* PEP8 style guidelines will be enforced.

* New features should come with corresponding additions to tests. pgmpl uses 
  unittest style testing. Tests should be included in the relevant file in the 
  tests/ directory. codecov should automatically measure test coverage when 
  you push to a branch with an open pull request; aim for 100% coverage.
